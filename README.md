Hello World! 
I'm young programmer and i've created calculator in python. You can change the colors and the setting are stored in txt files, so when you reopen your calc your colors will load. If you want to change them please click 'c' on your keyboard, then press the botton you selected, if you want to change color of calculator screen, please click 't' on your keyboard in color settings. If you want to change font color please press 'f' in keyboard settings, then do same things as in color settings. If you want to go back to calculator please press 'c' on your keyboard, but when you want to go back to default settings please click 'd' in color settings. When you want to calculate the square root, first enter the number, followed by the square root. All code is about 425 lines and is written in python. :)
